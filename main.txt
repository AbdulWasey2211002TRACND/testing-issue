Certainly! Here's an example of a Python program that uses recursion:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
result = factorial(num)
print("The factorial of", num, "is", result)
```

In this program, the `factorial` function is defined to calculate the factorial of a given number `n`. It uses recursion by calling itself with a smaller value of `n` until the base case (`n == 0`) is reached. The factorial of `n` is calculated by multiplying `n` with the factorial of `n-1`. Finally, the program prompts the user to enter a number, calculates its factorial using the `factorial` function, and prints the result.
